# #### Import Python packages 

# In[1]:


# Import Python packages 
import pandas as pd

import re
import os
import glob
import numpy as np
import json
import csv


# #### Creating list of filepaths to process original event csv data files

# In[2]:


# checking your current working directory
print(os.getcwd())

# # Part II. Complete the Apache Cassandra coding portion of your project. 
# 
# ## Now you are ready to work with the CSV file titled <font color=red>event_datafile_new.csv</font>, located within the Workspace directory.  The event_datafile_new.csv contains the following columns: 
# - artist 
# - firstName of user
# - gender of user
# - item number in session
# - last name of user
# - length of the song
# - level (paid or free song)
# - location of the user
# - sessionId
# - song title
# - userId
# 
# The image below is a screenshot of what the denormalized data should appear like in the <font color=red>**event_datafile_new.csv**</font> after the code above is run:<br>

# ## Begin writing your Apache Cassandra code in the cells below

# #### Creating a Cluster

# In[5]:

# #### Create Keyspace

# In[6]:

# In[7]:

# ### Now we need to create tables to run the following queries. Remember, with Apache Cassandra you model the database tables on the queries you want to run.

# ## Create queries to ask the following three questions of the data
# 
# ### 1. Give me the artist, song title and song's length in the music app history that was heard during  sessionId = 338, and itemInSession  = 4
# 
# 
# ### 2. Give me only the following: name of artist, song (sorted by itemInSession) and user (first and last name) for userid = 10, sessionid = 182
#     
# 
# ### 3. Give me every user name (first and last) in my music app history who listened to the song 'All Hands Against His Own'
